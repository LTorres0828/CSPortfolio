## About Me
My name is Luis, and I am currently studying for my masters degree in cybersecurity at Chestnut Hill College. I am passionate and eager to begin a career in cybersecurity. My passion for helping others and dedication to learning make me a strong candidate for a cybersecurity analyst position as I am excited to continue learning and to contribute to a team that values security and innovation.

I recently obtained the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate to pursue my passion in technology and cybersecurity. My Google Cybersecurity Certificate prepared me for entry levelÂ industry-ready roles. My ultimate goal is to enter the field of cybersecurity as an entry-level professional. This role is an ideal match for me since I have strong analytical skills, determination, a willingness to learn, a can-do attitude, problem-solving abilities, and communication skills to deal with challenges and developing threats. As of October 2024, I am preparing to take the `Security+`, `CISSP` certifications.
